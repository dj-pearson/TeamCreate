🎨 Style Guide for Plugin UI

1. Color Palette
   Primary background: Very dark gray (#0f111a or similar)

Secondary panels: Slightly lighter gray with low opacity overlays

Accent colors: Neon blues, purples, magentas, and teals for highlights and charts

Text: White for main content, light gray for labels, with subtle glowing colors for tags/status

Callouts: Use bright green/red for success/error states (e.g., trading graph colors)

2. Typography
   Font: Use a modern sans-serif font (like Inter, Manrope, or Poppins)

Weighting: Medium (500) for labels, Bold (700) for headers

Sizes:

Headers: 18-22px

Subtext: 12-14px

Data/Stats: 16px bold

3. UI Components
   Panels / Cards:
   Rounded corners (8px)

Shadow with subtle glow

Hover state: slight scale-up with a blue/purple glow border

Buttons:
Flat or gradient backgrounds (blue/purple)

White or neon icon/text

Rounded with tight padding (8px vertical, 16px horizontal)

Tabs / Navigation:
Vertical sidebar with icons

Use a selected tab indicator: vertical colored bar or glow dot

Group icons into sections (collapsed view supported)

Charts:
Highcharts or Recharts-style with:

Clean gridlines

Gradient-filled candles/bars

Tooltip on hover

Minimal axis labels

Tables:
Dark rows with slight hover highlight

Bordered cells with neon hover line

Icons for actions (edit, delete) using outlined white or color-accented SVGs

⚙️ UX Patterns
Focus on data clarity: No unnecessary decoration

Quick scan UX: Use color tags, badges, and icons for rapid recognition

Responsive layout: Cards reflow into columns on smaller views

Live data feel: Use blinking or pulsing status dots for activity indication

✨ Micro-interactions
Framer Motion for animation: sliding in panels, fade-in graphs

Animated counters for values

Subtle background blur on modals/popups

🔌 Plugin Usage in Roblox Studio
To align with this style inside Studio:

Use DockWidgetPluginGui with custom frames

Add custom dark-mode widgets with rounded corners and outlined icons

For charts, use web-based panels (HTML viewport or external window) where needed, or represent graphs using color-coded frames for simpler builds
