# Roblox Data Store Plugin Compliance Guide

**Data store plugins face strict compliance requirements due to privacy protections and security standards.** Most violations stem from unauthorized data access, external dependencies, and inadequate privacy safeguards, particularly for users under 13. This analysis identifies specific violation points and provides actionable recommendations to achieve compliance.

## Critical violation points for data store plugins

**The most common rejection reason is "Misusing Roblox Systems,"** which typically indicates external script loading, unauthorized system access, or security bypass attempts. For data store plugins specifically, violations often involve unauthorized data collection, improper age verification, or failure to implement required security measures.

**External dependencies represent the highest risk factor.** Plugins using `require(ID)` calls to load external scripts are automatically flagged, as this technique enables backdoor installation and malicious code injection. Even legitimate plugins face rejection when using external dependencies, regardless of their intended purpose.

**Privacy violations are particularly problematic** given Roblox's substantial under-13 user base. Plugins that collect personal information beyond user ID and username, fail to implement COPPA protections, or bypass age verification systems face immediate rejection and potential developer sanctions.

## Roblox Community Standards analysis

**Universal compliance requirements apply to all plugin functionality,** including data manipulation tools. The Community Standards prohibit any content or functionality that compromises account security, bypasses safety systems, or facilitates unauthorized access to user data. These standards specifically target tools that could enable predatory behavior, harassment, or circumvention of safety measures.

**Data security requirements are non-negotiable.** Plugins cannot compromise Roblox accounts, attempt unauthorized access, or bypass safety systems. The platform maintains zero tolerance for tools that facilitate scamming, phishing, or other malicious activities targeting user data.

**Thread Identity 6 permissions** grant plugins "PluginSecurity" access to specific API functions, but this access comes with strict boundaries. Plugins operate in sandboxed Lua virtual machines to prevent interference with user scripts, and any attempt to exceed these boundaries triggers violation flags.

## Privacy and data protection requirements

**COPPA compliance is mandatory and heavily enforced.** Users under 13 automatically receive stronger privacy settings, chat filtering, and content restrictions. Data store plugins must implement PolicyService API checks before accessing any features that could expose personal information or enable inappropriate interactions.

**Prohibited data collection includes** birth dates, personal photos, phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, or any personally identifiable information beyond what Roblox provides. Developers can only access user ID, username, game metrics, UGC transaction details, and IP-based regional location (without the actual IP address).

**Required PolicyService API implementation** includes checking `AreAdsAllowed`, `ArePaidRandomItemsRestricted`, `AllowedExternalLinkReferences`, and `IsContentSharingAllowed` before enabling corresponding features. Failure to implement these checks results in automatic violation flags.

**GDPR and CCPA compliance** requires developers to honor verified deletion requests from Roblox, implement data minimization practices, and avoid collecting unnecessary personal information. Users must contact Roblox support directly for privacy requests, not plugin developers.

## Technical compliance requirements

**Server-side only data access** is mandatory for all DataStore operations. Plugins cannot access DataStores through LocalScripts or client-side code, and Studio access must be explicitly enabled through "Enable Studio Access to API Services" settings.

**UpdateAsync() must replace SetAsync()** for all data modifications to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency across multi-server environments. This requirement addresses the most common technical violation in data store plugins.

**Comprehensive error handling** using `pcall()` is required for all DataStore and PolicyService operations. Plugins must implement retry logic with exponential backoff and monitor request budgets using `GetRequestBudgetForRequestType()` to avoid exceeding platform limits.

**Data validation and sanitization** must prevent NaN values, nil injection, and oversized data submissions. All user inputs require type checking, size validation, and structure verification before storage operations.

## Specific compliance recommendations

**Remove all external dependencies immediately.** Replace any `require(ID)` calls with self-contained code within the plugin. This single change resolves the majority of "Misusing Roblox Systems" violations and dramatically improves approval likelihood.

**Implement proper permission architecture** by requesting only necessary permissions and clearly documenting their purpose. HTTP permissions require explicit user approval, and script modification permissions must be justified with transparent functionality descriptions.

**Add comprehensive PolicyService checks** before any data access or user interaction features. This includes age verification, advertising restrictions, and content sharing limitations. Wrap all PolicyService calls in `pcall()` with appropriate error handling.

**Follow secure coding practices** including input validation, size limitations, and proper error handling. Validate all data structures, check for malicious patterns, and implement robust retry mechanisms for network operations.

**Ensure transparent operations** by providing clear user notifications for all data access activities. Users should understand what data is being accessed, why it's necessary, and how it will be used. Hidden functionality triggers violation flags.

## Plugin modification strategies

**Create self-contained plugin architecture** by consolidating all functionality within the main plugin script. Replace external dependencies with local functions and remove any obfuscated code that could appear suspicious to moderation systems.

**Implement ChangeHistoryService integration** for proper undo/redo functionality. This demonstrates professional development practices and ensures user control over plugin operations.

**Add comprehensive logging and error reporting** to help users understand plugin behavior and troubleshoot issues. Professional error handling and user feedback mechanisms improve approval likelihood.

**Design age-appropriate functionality** by implementing proper PolicyService checks and ensuring all features comply with COPPA requirements. This includes content filtering, advertising restrictions, and communication limitations for users under 13.

## Best practices for ongoing compliance

**Regular policy monitoring** is essential as Roblox frequently updates security requirements and community standards. Subscribe to developer announcements and regularly review updated documentation to maintain compliance.

**Proactive security auditing** should include testing for new vulnerability patterns, updating error handling procedures, and validating continued compliance with evolving terms of service.

**Professional development practices** including comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and transparent functionality descriptions significantly improve approval rates and reduce violation risks.

**Community engagement** through official developer forums helps identify emerging compliance issues and solutions before they become widespread problems.

## Conclusion

**Success requires conservative development practices and strict adherence to security protocols.** The key to compliant data store plugins lies in eliminating external dependencies, implementing comprehensive privacy safeguards, and maintaining transparent operations throughout the user experience. Plugin developers must prioritize user safety, data protection, and platform security over advanced functionality that might trigger violation flags.

Most importantly, plugins should enhance the development experience while operating within Roblox's security framework rather than attempting to circumvent platform limitations. This approach ensures long-term viability and reduces the risk of rejection or post-approval violations that could impact developer standing on the platform.

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL BEST PRACTICES
Data Store Access Pattern
lua-- GOOD: Server-side only
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local myStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("MyStore")

-- BAD: Never in LocalScript
-- This will cause violations
Studio API Access
lua-- Only when "Enable Studio Access to API Services" is enabled
-- Always check for this setting and inform users if disabled
Proper Update Pattern
lua-- GOOD: Use UpdateAsync for consistency
dataStore:UpdateAsync(key, function(currentValue)
    -- Modify and return new value
    return newValue
end)

-- AVOID: SetAsync can cause race conditions
-- dataStore:SetAsync(key, value)  -- Less safe
Request Throttling
lua-- Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
local function safeDataStoreCall(operation)
    local retries = 0
    local maxRetries = 3
    local baseDelay = 1
    
    while retries < maxRetries do
        local success, result = pcall(operation)
        if success then
            return result
        end
        
        retries = retries + 1
        if retries < maxRetries then
            wait(baseDelay * (2 ^ retries))
        end
    end
    
    error("DataStore operation failed after " .. maxRetries .. " attempts")
